# tkeel-plugin-template-go

This is a template we have given for Go language developers to quickly build a plugin application.

## Usage
We have a development tool that will automatically download this template for you: [artisan](https://github.com/tkeel-io/tkeel-interface/tree/main/tool ).

According to the _**artisan**_ documentation, you can find the `Quick Start' document, which describes how to use this template.

1. Use the _**artisan**_ to quickly generate the **proto** you need in the `api` directory and define the structures you need in it.
2. Automatic generation of the transport layer source files required for the service via **proto** files
3. Use the _**artisan**_ to generate the **service** files into `/pkg/service` and then write your own business logic in them.
4. Adding your services to the server in `cmd/your/main.go`.
5. Run your server
